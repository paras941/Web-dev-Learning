🌐 WEB-DEV-LEARNING

This repository contains resources, notes, and practice projects to learn HTML & CSS.
It covers everything from basics to advanced topics along with hands-on projects.

📘 HTML Topics

Introduction to HTML & page structure

Headings, Paragraphs, Line breaks

Text formatting (bold, italic, underline, highlight, code, sup, sub)

Links & Images (absolute, relative, alt text)

Lists (ordered, unordered, nested)

Tables (rows, columns, rowspan, colspan)

Forms (inputs, labels, checkboxes, radio, dropdowns, textarea, buttons)

Semantic HTML (header, footer, section, article, nav)

Multimedia (audio, video, iframe)

🎨 CSS Topics

Introduction to CSS (inline, internal, external)

Colors (names, HEX, RGB, HSL)

Backgrounds (color, image, gradient)

Text styling (fonts, size, weight, alignment, spacing, Google Fonts)

Box Model (margin, padding, border, content, box-sizing)

Selectors (element, class, id, grouping, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements)

Display & Positioning (block, inline, flex, grid, absolute, relative, sticky, fixed)

Flexbox (layout, alignment, wrapping)

Grid (rows, columns, gap, templates, areas)

Units (px, %, em, rem, vh, vw)

Variables (--var)

Transitions & Animations (:hover, @keyframes)

Shadows & Gradients (box-shadow, text-shadow, linear & radial gradient)

Media Queries (responsive design)

Styling Forms & Buttons

Advanced Selectors (child, sibling, attribute)

# Javascript 


📌 Variables & Data Types

var → Function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted (value undefined until initialized).

let → Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared, better for debugging.

Dynamic typing → Variables can hold numbers, strings, etc.

Naming → Prefer camelCase (sumOfArray).

📌 Operators

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

Unary: ++, --

Logical: &&, ||, !

Comparison: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=

Ternary: (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

📌 Conditional Statements

if–else, if–else ladder, nested if–else, switch

Used for decision-making based on conditions (e.g., voting eligibility, grading, age categories).

📌 Strings

Created using ' ', " ", or backticks ` `.

Concatenation using + or template literals ${var}.

Useful methods: .length, .toUpperCase(), .toLowerCase(), .substring(), .split().

📌 Functions

Plain functions: Defined with function keyword; can return values.

Arrow functions: ES6 shorthand syntax (=>); often used for small calculations or callbacks.

Improves code reusability and modularity.

📌 Objects & Arrays

Objects store key-value pairs; support public/private properties in classes.

Arrays can store multiple values; common methods: push, pop, shift, slice, splice, map, filter, reduce.

📌 Hoisting

Functions: Declarations are fully hoisted, expressions are not.

Variables: var hoisted (value undefined), let/const in TDZ (cannot access before declaration).

Objects: Declared with let/const are not hoisted.

📌 Classes

Blueprints for objects.

Support constructor, public/private properties, getters/setters, and methods.

📌 Built-in Objects

Math: PI, max, min, round, floor, ceil, abs, random, pow.

Date: Retrieve current date and time.
