This repository contains resources, notes, and practice projects to learn HTML & CSS.
It covers everything from basics to advanced topics along with hands-on projects.

📘 HTML Topics

📌 Page Structure

<!DOCTYPE html> → Defines the HTML version

<html> → Root element

<head> → Metadata, title, CSS/JS links

<body> → Visible content

Semantic elements: <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav>

📌 Headings & Text

Headings: <h1> … <h6>

Paragraphs: <p>

Line breaks: <br>

📌 Links & Images

Links: <a href="url">text</a>

Absolute vs Relative URLs

Images: <img src="path" alt="description">

📌 Lists

Ordered → <ol>

Unordered → <ul>

Nested → Lists inside lists

📌 Tables

Table structure → <table> with <tr>, <td>, <th>

Merge cells → rowspan, colspan

📌 Forms

Inputs → text, email, password, etc.

Labels → <label>

Checkboxes & Radio → <input type="checkbox/radio">

Dropdown → <select> + <option>

Textarea → <textarea>

Buttons → <button>

📌 Multimedia

Audio → <audio>

Video → <video>

Embedded content → <iframe>

🎨 CSS Topics

CSS Basics

Inline CSS: Added directly to an element via style attribute.

Internal CSS: Placed inside <style> tag within HTML <head>.

External CSS: Linked via an external .css file.

📌 Colors & Backgrounds

Colors: Named colors, HEX, RGB, HSL.

Backgrounds:

Color

Images

Gradients (linear & radial)

📌 Text Styling

Fonts, size, weight, alignment, spacing.

Integration of Google Fonts.

📌 Box Model

Components: margin, border, padding, content.

box-sizing property for layout control.

📌 Selectors

Basic: element, class, id, grouping.

Advanced: pseudo-classes (:hover, :first-child), pseudo-elements (::before, ::after).

Advanced Selectors: child, sibling, attribute selectors.

📌 Display & Positioning

block, inline, inline-block

flex, grid

Positioning: static, relative, absolute, sticky, fixed.

📌 Flexbox

Layout, alignment, wrapping of items in a container.

📌 Grid

Rows, columns, gap, templates, and named areas for layout.

📌 Units

px, %, em, rem, vh, vw

📌 CSS Variables

Custom properties using --variable-name.

Reusable values throughout stylesheets.

📌 Transitions & Animations

Smooth property changes: transition

Keyframe animations: @keyframes

Hover effects and interactive animations.

📌 Shadows & Gradients

Shadows: box-shadow, text-shadow

Gradients: linear-gradient, radial-gradient

📌 Responsive Design

Media Queries to adapt layout and styles on different devices.

📌 Forms & Buttons

Styling inputs, selects, checkboxes, radios, and buttons for modern UI.

📌 Variables & Data Types

var → Function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted (value undefined until initialized).

let → Block-scoped, cannot be redeclared, better for debugging.

Dynamic typing → Variables can hold numbers, strings, etc.

Naming → Prefer camelCase (sumOfArray).

📌 Operators

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %

Unary: ++, --

Logical: &&, ||, !

Comparison: ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, >=

Ternary: (condition) ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

📌 Conditional Statements

if–else, if–else ladder, nested if–else, switch

Used for decision-making based on conditions (e.g., voting eligibility, grading, age categories).

📌 Strings

Created using ' ', " ", or backticks ` `.

Concatenation using + or template literals ${var}.

Useful methods: .length, .toUpperCase(), .toLowerCase(), .substring(), .split().

📌 Functions

Plain functions: Defined with function keyword; can return values.

Arrow functions: ES6 shorthand syntax (=>); often used for small calculations or callbacks.

Improves code reusability and modularity.

📌 Objects & Arrays

Objects store key-value pairs; support public/private properties in classes.

Arrays can store multiple values; common methods: push, pop, shift, slice, splice, map, filter, reduce.

📌 Hoisting

Functions: Declarations are fully hoisted, expressions are not.

Variables: var hoisted (value undefined), let/const in TDZ (cannot access before declaration).

Objects: Declared with let/const are not hoisted.

📌 Classes

Blueprints for objects.

Support constructor, public/private properties, getters/setters, and methods.

📌 Built-in Objects

Math: PI, max, min, round, floor, ceil, abs, random, pow.

Date: Retrieve current date and time.
